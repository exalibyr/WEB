this project demonstrates my blog. It's something like VK. (At least during developing i was taking such style as example)
it's still raw, in first version i would say. But it can does basic thing, like save, update, read data.
So far, you can create personal account, sign in, search for other users, view their pages and posts and, of course, make your own ones.
Back-end: Java 8 SE, Spring boot, Spring framework (data, webmvc), hibernate.
Front-end: html via thymeleaf

0.2:added abilities - log out, edit profile and delete post.
